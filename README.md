# Personal Beacon

Modjam 5 mod!

Well, mod name may change because of unexpected ideas during development

The idea is you have a personal beacon, an item that stays in your inventory. Below this item in your player inventory, you must have blocks below it in a pyramid shape to activate the beacon.

Of course, you can have the beacon in the top row, 3 blocks in second row, 5 in third row, and you may sacrifice 7 slots in your hotbar. *cue maniacal laughter*



# Ideas

 - Place beacon cost item next to beacon plus potion to set beacon effect(s)
 - Personal Enchantment table (place bookshelves around it, in inventory, stacks of bookshelves or other providers do matter)
 - Octuple Compressed Bookshelf to be beacon provider and bookshelf provider
 - Maybe a Personal furnace?
